- `/workload` - Check agent workload distribution
- `/standup` - Get daily standup summary
- `/sync_vibe` - Sync with Vibe Kanban board

### Creating Tasks

Just ask August naturally:

```
"Create a task to fix the email sync bug"
"We need to implement dark mode"
"Add a task for improving performance"
```

August will:
1. Decide on the right agent (Architect, Engineer, Designer, etc.)
2. Set appropriate priority (P0-P3)
3. Create the task immediately
4. Explain the reasoning

### Technical Discussions

Ask questions about your codebase:

```
"What is the edge function doing?"
"How does the email sync work?"
"Can you explain the authentication flow?"
"Why do we need the cache layer?"
```

August will:
- Use GPT-5 for deep technical analysis
- Respond conversationally (not like documentation)
- Share 2-3 key insights
- Skip obvious details

### Task Status

Check on progress naturally:

```
"What's in progress?"
"Show me blocked tasks"
"What is the team working on?"
```

### Vibe Kanban Integration

If you're using [Vibe Kanban](https://vibekanban.com) locally:

1. Make sure Vibe is running on `http://127.0.0.1:52822`
2. Update `vibe_sync.py` with your project ID
3. Use `/sync_vibe` command
4. Click "‚¨áÔ∏è Import from Vibe" or "‚¨ÜÔ∏è Export to Vibe"

## Examples

### Creating a Task
```
User: "We need to fix the email sync bug affecting all users"

August: Got it - email sync bug. A few quick questions:
- What's the specific symptom?
- Do we have Sentry errors to reference?

Based on this, I'm thinking:
- Agent: üíª Engineer (with üß™ QA for verification)
- Priority: üî¥ P0 (user-facing bug)

Creating task now...
```

### Status Check
```
User: /standup

August: Morning standup:

üèÉ In Progress (2)
‚Ä¢ Vertex AI migration (engineer)
‚Ä¢ Paywall UI design (designer)

üëÄ In Review (1)
‚Ä¢ Cache optimization (architect)

‚ùå Blocked (1)
‚Ä¢ Analytics export (waiting on access)
```

### Sprint Planning
```
User: "What should we focus on next sprint?"

August: Here's what I'm thinking for Sprint 12...

- `bot.py` - Main bot application and handlers
- `agents.py` - Agent definitions and expertise
- `task_manager.py` - Task persistence and state machine
- `august_prompt.py` - August's comprehensive system prompt (2000+ tokens)
- `tasks.db` - SQLite database for task storage

- **Task Status** ‚Üí GPT-4o-mini (1500 tokens) - fast for status updates
- **General/Task Creation** ‚Üí GPT-4o (2500 tokens) - balanced for tasks

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+ (required for telegram-bot compatibility)
- OpenAI API key with GPT-5 access
- Telegram Bot Token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- Your Telegram User ID (get from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd telegram-code-agent
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot==20.7 openai requests
```

4. **Configure the bot**

Edit `bot.py` and update these configuration values:

```python
TELEGRAM_TOKEN = "your-telegram-bot-token"
ALLOWED_USER_ID = your-telegram-user-id  # Get from @userinfobot
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key"
REPO_PATH = "/path/to/your/codebase"  # Optional: for code discussions
```

5. **Run the bot**

AGENTS["new_agent"] = Agent(
    id="new_agent",
    name="Agent Name",
    emoji="üî•",
    role="Role Description",
    expertise=["Skill 1", "Skill 2"],
    personality="Personality description"
)
```

- Daily summary time (default: 9:00 AM)
- Alert thresholds for blocked/stale tasks

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit secrets to git!**

The `.gitignore` includes:
- API keys
- Database files (tasks.db)
- Virtual environment

For production use:
1. Use environment variables for secrets instead of hardcoding
2. Set up proper authentication
3. Run bot as a service (systemd, Docker, etc.)
4. Enable HTTPS for Vibe Kanban if exposed
